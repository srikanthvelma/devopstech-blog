# Docker Basics

Docker is a platform that enables developers to build, deploy, and manage applications in lightweight, portable containers. It simplifies application deployment by packaging code and dependencies together.

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source containerization platform that allows you to:

- Create containers to run applications.
- Ensure consistency across environments (development, testing, production).
- Improve resource utilization and scalability.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Containers**
Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable units that include everything needed to run an application.

### 2. **Images**
Docker images are templates used to create containers. They are immutable and can be shared via Docker Hub.

### 3. **Dockerfile**
A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions to build a Docker image.

### 4. **Docker Hub**
Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry for sharing container images.

## Basic Docker Commands

| Command                          | Description                              |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `docker run <image>`             | Run a container from an image.           |
| `docker ps`                      | List running containers.                 |
| `docker build -t <name> .`       | Build an image from a Dockerfile.        |
| `docker pull <image>`            | Download an image from Docker Hub.       |
| `docker stop <container_id>`     | Stop a running container.                |

## Benefits of Docker

- **Portability**: Run containers on any system with Docker installed.
- **Efficiency**: Containers use fewer resources than virtual machines.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale applications using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

## Getting Started with Docker

1. Install Docker from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/).
2. Pull an image: `docker pull hello-world`.
3. Run a container: `docker run hello-world`.

## Conclusion

Docker is a powerful tool for modern application development. By understanding its basics, you can streamline your development and deployment processes.
