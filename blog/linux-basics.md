## 1. What is Linux?
Linux is a Unix-like operating system kernel created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility.

## 2. Linux Distributions
A Linux distribution (distro) is a version of Linux bundled with additional software. Popular distributions include:
- **Ubuntu**
- **Fedora**
- **Debian**
- **CentOS**
- **Arch Linux**

## 3. Basic Linux Commands
Here are some essential commands:
- `ls` - List directory contents
- `cd` - Change directory
- `pwd` - Print working directory
- `cp` - Copy files
- `mv` - Move or rename files
- `rm` - Remove files
- `man` - Display manual pages

## 4. File System Structure
Linux uses a hierarchical file system structure:
- `/` - Root directory
- `/home` - User home directories
- `/etc` - Configuration files
- `/var` - Variable data files
- `/usr` - User programs and libraries

## 5. Permissions and Ownership
Linux uses a permission system to control access:
- **Read (r)**, **Write (w)**, **Execute (x)**
- Use `chmod` to change permissions and `chown` to change ownership.

## 6. Package Management
Package managers simplify software installation:
- **Debian-based (e.g., Ubuntu):** `apt`
- **Red Hat-based (e.g., Fedora):** `dnf` or `yum`

## 7. Conclusion
Linux is a versatile operating system with a rich ecosystem. Mastering the basics is the first step toward leveraging its full potential.
