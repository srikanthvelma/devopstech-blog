# K8S Service

## Networking in K8S

* For Pods k8s will create a separate internal network, from there only all pods will get an IP Address and as all pods are in same network, they are able to communicate with each other.

* So we can also access those pods from the node by SSH into or access in the browser if it has the web browser.

* But to access the pod/app from external, we need k8s Workload called **service**,which can be created by yaml file as others

* To handle this network in between nodes and pods, pods of different nodes, we need to install/attach an external feature to k8s cluster - flannel,calico,cisco...etc
