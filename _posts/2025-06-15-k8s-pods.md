# Kubernetes Pods

A **Pod** is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster. Pods can contain one or more containers, which share storage, network, and a specification for how to run the containers.

## Key Features

- **Single or Multiple Containers:** Most Pods run a single container, but they can also run multiple tightly coupled containers.
- **Shared Resources:** Containers in a Pod share the same IP address, port space, and storage volumes.
- **Ephemeral:** Pods are designed to be ephemeral; if a Pod dies, Kubernetes can automatically create a new instance.

## Example: Single-Container Pod

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: nginx-pod
spec:
    containers:
        - name: nginx
            image: nginx:latest
            ports:
                - containerPort: 80
```

## Example: Multi-Container Pod

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: multi-container-pod
spec:
    containers:
        - name: app
            image: busybox
            command: ["sleep", "3600"]
        - name: sidecar
            image: busybox
            command: ["sleep", "3600"]
```

Pods are fundamental to deploying and managing applications in Kubernetes.
